Tutorized Application is a system that allows students to schedule time with a tutor in their subject of expertise. Once the appointment has been requested by the student, the tutor accepts this appointment. Additionally, this system provides the ability for a student and the tutor to chat. This application ensures that students are getting as much help as they need in a timely, organized manner.
